In order to perform a time series analysis, we may need to separate seasonality and trend from our series. The resultant series will become  stationary through this process. So let us separate Trend and Seasonality from the time series. We start by taking a log of the series to reduce the magnitude of the values and reduce the rising trend in the series.  Then after getting the log of the series, we find the rolling average of the series. A rolling average is calculated by taking input for  the past 12 months and giving a mean consumption value at every point further ahead in series.  Auto ARIMA: Automatically discover the optimal order for an ARIMA model. The auto_arima function seeks to identify the most optimal parameters for an ARIMA model, and returns a fitted ARIMA model.  This function is based on the commonly-used R function, forecast::auto.arima. The auro_arima function works by conducting differencing tests (i.e., Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin, Augmented Dickey-Fuller or Phillips–Perron)  to determine the order of differencing, d, and then fitting models within ranges of defined start_p, max_p, start_q, max_q ranges.  If the seasonal optional is enabled, auto_arima also seeks to identify the optimal P and Q hyper- parameters after conducting the Canova-Hansen  to determine the optimal order of seasonal differencing.
