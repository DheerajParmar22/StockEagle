
These components are defined as follows:
Level: The average value in the series.
Trend: The increasing or decreasing value in the series.
Seasonality: The repeating short-term cycle in the series.
Noise: The random variation in the series.

The null and alternate hypothesis of this test is:
Null Hypothesis: The series has a unit root (value of a =1)
Alternate Hypothesis: The series has no unit root.

We see that the p-value is greater than 0.05 so we cannot reject the Null hypothesis. Also, the test statistics are greater than the critical values. 
so the data is non-stationary.

In order to perform a time series analysis, we may need to separate seasonality and trend from our series. The resultant series will become 
stationary through this process.
So let us separate Trend and Seasonality from the time series.
We start by taking a log of the series to reduce the magnitude of the values and reduce the rising trend in the series. 
Then after getting the log of the series, we find the rolling average of the series. A rolling average is calculated by taking input for 
the past 12 months and giving a mean consumption value at every point further ahead in series.

Auto ARIMA: Automatically discover the optimal order for an ARIMA model.
The auto_arima function seeks to identify the most optimal parameters for an ARIMA model, and returns a fitted ARIMA model. 
This function is based on the commonly-used R function, forecast::auto.arima.
The auro_arima function works by conducting differencing tests (i.e., Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin, Augmented Dickey-Fuller or Phillips–Perron) 
to determine the order of differencing, d, and then fitting models within ranges of defined start_p, max_p, start_q, max_q ranges. 
If the seasonal optional is enabled, auto_arima also seeks to identify the optimal P and Q hyper- parameters after conducting the Canova-Hansen 
to determine the optimal order of seasonal differencing, D.
